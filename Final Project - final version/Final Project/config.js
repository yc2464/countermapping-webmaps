    title: "The Impact of Covid-19 on Senior Adults' Public Transportation Utilization and Travel Patterns",
    subtitle: 'A Case Study of Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART)',
    byline: 'By Leah Chen',
    //image: 'images/The Change of Age Distribution from 2018-2022.jpg',
    para1: 'This study will focus on the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) as its primary research subject. Serving as a crucial regional public transportation system in the Bay Area, BART connects five counties. However, due to Covid-19, ridership dramatically decreased and has not yet been able to recover to its pre-pandemic levels. This decline may be partially attributed to tech workers in the Bay Area continuing to work from home, resulting in an increased proportion of senior adults in all revenue ticket sales. Furthermore, from 2020 to 2022, the ridership for senior adults was 32.42%, 30.71%, and 47.46% respectively of the 2019 figures. In comparison, the numbers for all revenue trips were 27.42%, 20.93%, and 35.01% respectively, indicating that the elderly rely more heavily on BART and returned to using it sooner than the general population.',
    para2: 'As the elderly age, they experience functional limitations, manifesting as vision declines, diminished physical fitness and flexibility, decreased ability to focus attention, and an increase in reaction time (Lynott et al., 2009). This is a very serious question, because a decrease in mobility further disconnects them from society, leading to personal identity issues, increased social isolation, depression, and reduced physical and emotional health (Burkhardt, 2006). Thus, this research aims to delve into the root causes of this phenomenon, understanding the travel pattern differences for senior citizens during and after the pandemic. I aim to find out what demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of older adults who were still using BART to get around during the pendemic. By doing so, we seek to understand how we can ensure mobility for senior citizens, allowing them to travel freely and enjoy life.',
